To run this program, first ensure that `python3` with the modules `tkinter`, `numpy`, `sympy`, and `matplotlib` 
are installed on your computer. The first of these comes with Python. The other three can be installed with
`pip3` by typing `pip3 install numpy sympy matplotlib` in the command line. Now clone or download this
repository and run the file `main.py`. You should obtain a GUI with two graphs and GUI controls on the right side.


Special thanks to the creators and maintainers of [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). 
Their fantastic module makes it possible to parse and manipulate functions in a symbolic fashion.
Also thanks to those who contributed to Numpy, Matplotlib, and Tkinter.
